Today's process mining techniques have empowered numerous modern
organizations to use process execution data --- available from many
contemporary enterprise information systems as event logs --- for
diagnosing and improving their business processes from multiple
perspectives and on a continuing basis.
Human resources contribute an area less explored in process mining, but
are recognized as an impactful factor to business process improvement.

My research looks into the human resource perspective of process mining
and centers around organizational model mining from event logs.
We develop models, methods, and software tools to extract insights into
human resource groupings and behavior relevant to business process
execution.
In doing so, we aim to support organizations to make guided decisions on
staff deployment and organization design.
Our research is built within *OrdinoR*, a
framework for organizational model mining, as illustrated below.

</div>

What underpins this framework is our notion of organizational model that
captures human resources, their groups, and the connection between the
groupings and process execution.
With this novel notion, OrdinoR lays the foundation of many exciting
topics being researched --- for example, how can we use organizational models 
discovered from event logs to analyze the behavior of resources groups working 
in processes?

Besides the theoretical part of research, we are also developing an
open-source Python toolkit that implements OrdinoR and the relevant methods and 
techniques. Keep an eye on us if you find this topic interesting --- the party 
has started 🥳!
